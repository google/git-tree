# git-tree

*This is not an officially supported Google product.*

`git-tree` is a wrapper around `git log --graph` that heuristically determines
what set of commits should be displayed. It is designed for use with
branch-heavy workflows similar to those supported by the [Mercurial `evolve`
extension](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/EvolveExtension).

Command-line arguments are passed through to `git log`, allowing the user to set
up their own formatting options.

For example, I have the following alias in my `.bashrc` to invoke `git-tree`:

```
alias git-tree='git-tree --format="%C(auto)%h %d %<(50,trunc)%s"'
```

This produces output similar to the following (albeit colorized by default,
which makes it much more readable than this example):
```
